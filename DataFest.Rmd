# Jail Data

```{r Overview of Data}
jails %>%
  summarise(n(), n_distinct(State)) 
```

We have data from 334 counties from 27 states.

```{r}
topTenJails <- jails %>%
  arrange(Percentage.Change) %>%
  select(State, County, Percentage.Change) %>%
  slice(1:10)

ggplot(data = topTenJails, mapping = aes(x = reorder(County, Percentage.Change), 
                                         y = abs(Percentage.Change) * 100)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(x = "County", y = "Percent Decrease in Prisons", 
       title = "Top Ten Drops in Incarceration Rates in County Jails") 
```

```{r bunch_of_graphs}
ggplot(data = jails, aes(x = Percentage.Change)) +

ggplot(data = jails, aes(x = County.Profile)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = .025)

ggplot(data = jails, aes(x = State.Profile)) +
geom_histogram(binwidth = 5)

jails$Jurisdiction.Profile = jails$Jurisdiction.Profile..R.B.M.

ggplot(data = jails, aes(x = Jurisdiction.Profile)) +
  geom_bar()

ggplot(data = jails, aes(x = Jail.Incarceration.Rate.Per.100K)) +
geom_histogram()

ggplot(data = jails, aes(x = COVID.19.Cases)) +
  geom_histogram()

jails %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(COVID.19.Cases), ## Also log transform this?
            median = median(COVID.19.Cases)
  )

ggplot(data = jails, aes(x = log(Deaths.Per.100K.Residents))) + ### Log transform variable?

```

```{r Step-wise Strategy for Model Fitting}

                Jurisdiction.Profile, data = jails)

tidy(lm) %>%
  select(term, estimate, p.value)
```
#^Stepwise function uses similar strategy to adjusted R squared to find the best
#fit model with constrinas in mind. Here, it finds that Jurisdiction.Profile is 
#the most important relationship
```{r graph Jurisdiction.Profile vs. Percentage.Change:}

This graph doesn't look very legit...

```{r diagnostic_plots}
plot_diagnostic <- function(x, data) {
  
  plot_residuals <- augment(x) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) +
    geom_point() + 
    geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "blue", lty = 2) +
    labs(x = expression(hat(y)), y = "Residual Value", 
         title = "Residuals Plot") 
  
  plot_normality <- augment(x) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = .resid)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = .01, alpha = .5, color = "orange") + 
    labs(x = "Residual Value", y = "Count", title = "Normality Plot") 
  
  plot_independence <- augment(x) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = 1:nrow(data), y = .resid)) + 
    geom_point() + 
    labs(x = "Index", y = "Residual Value", title = "Independence Plot") 
  
  plot_residuals / (plot_normality + plot_independence)
}

plot_diagnostic(lm, jails)
```
Conditions of Linearity:

Condition 1: We must verify that observations are independent. In this case, 
there doesnâ€™t seem to be a pattern in the residual scatter plot, so the 
observations are independent.

Conditions 2 & 4: We must verify that the distribution of residuals is around 0 
and has constant variance. The variance plot shows that the distribution of 
residuals is centered around 0 and has constant variance throughout.

Condition 3: We must verify the normality of residuals. The residual histogram 
displays a normal distribution of residual values, so we have verified the 
normality of residuals.

```{r Lets try county.profile now}
lm(Percentage.Change ~ County.Profile, data = jails) %>%
  tidy()

ggplot(data = jails, aes(x = County.Profile, y = log(abs(Percentage.Change)))) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) + 
  theme_minimal()
```
Doesn't seem very legit either...
